    <h1><strong>The Rhino</strong></h1>

    <p>The <strong>rhino</strong> is an animal from  Ancient Greek nosehorned member of any of the five exant species of odd-toed ungulates in the family Rhinocerotidae.The rhinoceros is a herbivore. Its favourite food is plants, branches and bushes (if it is a browser species), or grass (if it is a grazer species).Rhinoceroses have a large horn on the nose. Their horns are not like those of other horned mammals: the rhinoceros' horn is made of keratin packed together very tightly.The rhinoceroses can weigh up to 2,000 kilograms (4,400 lb) and be up to 375 centimetres (12.30 ft) tall.

    <h2><em>The Rhinos and the humans</em></h2>

    <p><em>Only the white rhinoceros is not in critical danger of becoming extinct </em>. They are protected, but hunted mainly by poachers, for their horns. <strong>The horns are used in Asian medicine, similar to elephants and tigers, and for dagger handles in Yemen and Oman.</strong> Loss of habitat is also a danger to rhinos. Governments have made logging their habitat and poaching illegal.</p>
